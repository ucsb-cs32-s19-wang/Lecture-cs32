-----------------------------------------------Testing------------------------------------------------
首先弄个tddfuncs
    - 里面可以有个 
        ASSERT_EQUALS( EXPECTED VALUE, ACTUAL VALUE);
    - 然后一直overload 
        ASSERT_EQUALS(int, int)
        ASSERT_EQUALS(string, string)
        ASSERT_EQUALS(double, double)
        ASSERT_EQUALS(template, template)

-----------------------------------------------Inheritance------------------------------------------------
Some commong lingo:
    - A person class is the base class of a student
    - A student is derived class or subclass or child class of a person
    - the ":" operator means we're inheriting from the person class

    protected:
        - can have an addititonal protected field
        - protected members are accessible in the class that defines them 
            and in classes that inherit from that class
    
    public inheritance:
        When deriving a class from a public base class, 
        public memebr of the base class become public members of the derived class and protected members
        of the base class become protected memebres of the derived class.

    protected inheritance:
        When deriving from a protected base class, public and protected members of the base class
        become protected members of derived class

    private Inheritance:
        When deriving from a private base class, public and protected members of the base 
        class become private members of the derived class.

    Note:
        A base class' private members are never accessible directly from a derived class,
        but can be accessed through calls to public and protected members of the base class.
